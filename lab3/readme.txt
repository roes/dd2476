How is the relevance feedback process affected by alpha and beta?

Why is the search after feedback slower?
Several reasons. Weights need to be recalculated, more terms are added to the query, both of these factors cause the search to take more time.

Why is the number of returned documents larger?
We've expanded the query with more terms which results in more documents containing one or more of these terms.

Why are there more highly ranked short documents?
